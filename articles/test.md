# Why is one of the most profitable companies so reluctant with developing good games?

My personal website is finally ready to serve blog articles. I wonder what kind of stuff I'll be writing.
For the moment, I'll reorganize the code and make things easier to use.
I'd like to connect all this shit to a Notion API to make writing and sharing more convenient.
